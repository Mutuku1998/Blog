I've always been drawn to the beauty and serenity of the great outdoors. 
So, when the opportunity arose for a 
solo camping trip in the remote wilderness of the Sokoke forest, 
I jumped at the chance. Little did I know that this adventure would turn into an unforgettable
 story of survival and self-discovery.
